# Bellabeat-Data-Analysis
Data analysis of Bellabeat smart device usage to identify user behavior patterns and growth opportunities.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and supporting documentation for a data analysis project focused on Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures smart products for women. The goal of this analysis was to identify key consumer behavior patterns and trends from smart device usage data, providing data-driven insights to support Bellabeat's marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

## Problem Statement

*As a junior data analyst working on the marketing team at Bellabeat, my task was to analyze smart device usage data to identify key consumer behavior patterns and trends. The resulting insights aim to support the development of data-driven marketing strategies for unlocking new growth opportunities and enhancing customer engagement.*

## Data Source & Tools

* **Data Source:** Publicly available FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (from Kaggle), consisting of daily activity, sleep, and heart rate records for 35 users.
* **Tools:**
   * **Google Sheets:** For initial data review and basic calculations.
   * **RStudio (R):** For data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization.
   * **BigQuery:** For data storage, querying, and initial exploration of large datasets.
   * **Google Slides:** For creating the final presentation and visualizations.

## Analysis Process

This project followed the standard phases of the data analysis process:

1.  **ASK:** Defined the business problem, identified key stakeholders, and formulated guiding questions.
2.  **PREPARE:** Sourced the data, assessed its credibility and limitations, and created a plan for cleaning.
3.  **PROCESS:** Cleaned, transformed, and merged the data for analysis (handling missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates).
4.  **ANALYZE:** Explored trends, identified relationships, and performed calculations to uncover key user behaviors.
5.  **SHARE:** Communicated findings through a comprehensive report and a presentation, tailored for Bellabeat stakeholders.
6.  **ACT:** Proposed actionable steps based on insights and planned for future iterations.

## Key Findings

* **Consistent Activity Patterns:** Users exhibit predictable daily and weekly activity rhythms, with peak engagement in late morning, midday, and early evening.
* **Activity Drives Calorie Burn:** A strong positive correlation exists between physical activity levels (especially active minutes and intensity) and calorie expenditure.
* **Individual Variability:** User behavior is highly individualized; averages don't capture the full picture, and some users show unique activity/calorie patterns.
* **Data Limitations:** Sleep and heart rate data are significantly less consistent and less frequent compared to activity data, limiting holistic wellness insights.
* **Heart Rate Response:** For users with heart rate data, a clear physiological response was observed: average heart rate increases significantly with higher activity levels.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are key recommendations for Bellabeat:

* **Optimize Engagement Timing:** Leverage identified peak activity hours for targeted in-app notifications and marketing messages to maximize user receptivity.
* **Highlight Physiological Tracking:** Emphasize the device's ability to track physiological responses (like heart rate and calorie burn) to activity, educating users on what different heart rate zones mean for their goals.
* **Prioritize Personalization:** Develop features that offer highly personalized insights and adaptive goals, acknowledging the diverse and unique behaviors of individual users.
* **Enhance Data Consistency:** Strategically focus efforts on improving the consistency and volume of sleep and heart rate data collection through UX improvements.
